## Motivation

I want to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS and feel confident that I can accomplish what is required.

## Description
Review the original HTML and CSS code and find ways to leave a cleaner and better organized code.

## Requirements 

1. Use semantic structure/elements suchs as: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;
2. Links have to function properly 
3. Change, organize, and consolidate the CSS code for better readability
4. Add descriptive comments where fitting

## Installation
* Open your terminal (gitbash for Windows) and clone the github repository. [Click here for details](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
* Open the project repository in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Tools
* Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/)>.

## Takeaway

Following the Scout Rule, I was able to leave the code cleaner than when I found it. I have expanded my knowledge of HTML semantic structure, how floats function, consolidating CSS elements, among other things. I feel excited about taking on new projects and apply what I know.
