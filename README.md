# code-refactor
---
Welcome to my version of a marketing agency website called Horiseon. This exciting project put my knowledge of HTML and CSS to the test. 

The original HTML and CSS code needed a serious clean up. Among the things that needed fixing were the following: 

1. Too many div elements 
2. The code did not follow a semantic structure
3. Links did not function properly 
4. CSS selectors and properties were not properly organized or consolidated
5. There were no comments before an element or section of the page

These are the steps I took to refactor this code: 

1. Replaced all div elements with semantic tags suchs as: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;
2. Changed, organized, and consolidated the CSS so it is easy to follow  
3. Added descriptive comments were appropiate

Tools used in this project: Visual Studio Code, and Google Inspect Element.
